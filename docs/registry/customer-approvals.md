# Customer Approvals

{% hint style="info" %}
The customer's loan application must be approved by designated personnel, including branch officers, call agents, and headquarters representatives, before they can receive the loan.
{% endhint %}

The customer approval process ensures that all necessary checks and verifications are completed before a customer can receive a loan. The process begins with the Branch Manager approving customer details and progresses through contacting the individual listed in the customer's information by the Call Agent. Once the branch manager and call agent have completed their respective reviews and verifications, the customer information is forwarded to headquarters for final approval.

## Customer approval process

2. Under registry go to **Approval Pending**.
