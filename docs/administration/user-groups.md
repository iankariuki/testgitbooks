# User Groups

**User Groups** are collections of users assigned to specific roles or responsibilities within the system. In the context of loan processing, user groups are primarily used to **control access during the loan approval workflow**. By grouping users with approval rights, the system ensures that **only authorized personnel** can interact with customer records at critical decision-making stages.
